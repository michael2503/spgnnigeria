                            <p class="text-justify">There is no gainsaying the fact that nearly half of the global population are young people. The vast majority of them struggle to stay in school, to access training, to find a job, to make their voices heard in society. But if we empower these millions of young people, educate them, help them to become the best and most productive citizens they can be, we will set them on a course to improve their lives, grow their countriesâ€™ economies, strengthen their societies, lift up and empower the generations coming up behind them. This is why we explore the underlying foundations of growth - the experiences and relationships that help youth discover purpose, meaning, initiative, creativity, resilience, love of learning, empathy, and other internal strengths that foster a life of well-being. Our goal is that every Nigerian youth must possess the necessary life skills to succeed and lead a productive life.</p>
