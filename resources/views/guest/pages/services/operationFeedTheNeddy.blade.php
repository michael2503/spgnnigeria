                        <p class="text-justify">Year after year, during festive seasons, a lot of people/families are filled with excitements and expectations while there are some families with no financial means to bring the excitement of the season into their household. Based on this, SPGN birthed an initiative tagged – “Operation Feed the Needy” in 2016. This initiative is targeted at the less privilege in our communities to bring smiles to their faces by feeding them during each festive season.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">This project is designed to cater for the need of our brothers and sisters who are desperately in need of food for survival. It aims to provide sufficient food for those who are vulnerable and are not in situations to be empowered. The beneficiaries of this project are not limited by religion, ethnicity or age but are rather defined by their individual circumstances and needs. Some of the beneficiaries include: orphans or vulnerable children, hospital victims that have no access to food, internally displaced persons, person with disability, emergency disasters that require food provision etc.</p>
